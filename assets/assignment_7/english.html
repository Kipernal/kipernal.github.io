<p>English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval 
England and is now a global lingua franca. It is spoken as a first language by 
the majority populations of several sovereign states, including the United 
Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand and a 
number of Caribbean nations; and it is an official language of almost 60 
sovereign states. It is the third-most-common native language in the world, 
after Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. It is widely learned as a second language 
and is an official language of the European Union, many Commonwealth countries 
and the United Nations, as well as in many world organisations.</p>

<p>English arose in the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of England and what is now southeast 
Scotland. Following the extensive influence of England, Great Britain, and the 
United Kingdom from the 17th to mid-20th centuries through the British Empire, 
it has been widely propagated around the world. Through the spread of American-
dominated media and technology, English has become the leading language of 
international discourse and the lingua franca in many regions.</p>

<p>Historically, English originated from the fusion of closely related dialects, 
now collectively termed Old English, which were brought to the eastern coast 
of Great Britain by Germanic settlers (Anglo-Saxons) by the 5th century; the 
word English is simply the modern spelling of englisc, the name used by the 
Angles and Saxons for their language, after the Anglesâ€™ ancestral region of 
Angeln (in what is now Schleswig-Holstein). The language was also influenced 
early on by the Old Norse language through Viking invasions in the 9th and 
10th centuries.</p>

<p>The Norman conquest of England in the 11th century gave rise to heavy 
borrowings from Norman French, and vocabulary and spelling conventions began 
to give the appearance of a close relationship with those of Latin-derived 
Romance languages (though English is not a Romance language itself) to what 
had then become Middle English. The Great Vowel Shift that began in the south 
of England in the 15th century is one of the historical events that mark the 
emergence of Modern English from Middle English.</p>

<p>In addition to words inherited natively from Anglo-Saxon and those borrowed 
from Norman French, a significant number of English terms are derived from 
constructions based on root words originally taken from Latin, because Latin 
in some form was the lingua franca of the Christian Church and of European 
intellectual life and remains the wellspring of much modern scientific and 
technical vocabulary.</p>

<p>Owing to the assimilation of words from many other languages throughout 
history, modern English contains a very large vocabulary, with complex and 
irregular spelling, particularly of vowels. Modern English has not only 
assimilated words from other European languages, but from all over the world. 
The Oxford English Dictionary lists more than 250,000 distinct words, not 
including many technical, scientific, and slang terms.</p>
